## The Core Philosophy

Engineering isn't just about writing code; it's about building systems that survive the test of time. In a world obsessed with "moving fast and breaking things," there is a quiet power in moving intentionally and building things that stay fixed.

### Why Slow is Fast

When we rush, we accrue technical debt. Technical debt is like high-interest credit card debt:
1. It feels good at first (speed).
2. It quickly becomes a burden.
3. Eventually, you spend all your time paying interest (fixing bugs) instead of building new features.

### Key Takeaways

* **Documentation is a Love Letter:** Write it for your future self.
* **Simple > Complex:** If you can't explain it simply, it's too complex.
* **Test the Edge Cases:** That's where the real bugs live.

> "The best code is no code at all. The second best code is code that is easy to delete."

Stay intentional. Stay curious.
