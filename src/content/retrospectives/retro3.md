### The Monthly Intent
Going into February, the goal was to eliminate "digital noise." I found myself checking metrics too often and building for the sake of completion rather than quality.

### Wins & Highlights
* **Deep Work:** Managed three 4-hour blocks of uninterrupted coding per week.
* **Health:** Consistently hit 8,000 steps despite the heavy workload.
* **Learning:** Finished reading *The Timeless Way of Building*.

### Challenges
The biggest hurdle was "context switching." I realized that moving between design tasks and engineering tasks in the same afternoon was killing my momentum. Next month, I'll try "day-theming."

### Metrics & Habits
| Habit | Success Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| No Screen after 10 PM | 75% |
| Daily Meditation | 90% |
| Documentation First | 100% |

### Looking Ahead to March
March will be about **Exploration**. Now that the foundation is stable, it's time to experiment with new creative mediums.
