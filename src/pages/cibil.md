### The Intersection of Art and Code
For me, engineering isn't just about moving data from A to B. It’s about the elegance of the solution. Whether I’m working with **TypeScript and Java** or designing 3D-printed hardware, I look for the "click".

#### Current Focus: CIBIL Evaluation
I've been architecting a robust backend module to evaluate credit scores for personal loan applications. This project requires:
* High data accuracy
* System reliability
* Clean, maintainable logic

> "Build with intention, or don't build at all."

When I'm not at my desk, you'll likely find me practicing **Kannada** or exploring the mountains near Sakleshpur.
