### The Engineering Behind the Score

Building the **CIBIL in PL** evaluation system required a focus on both data integrity and high-performance backend logic. In a corporate environment, the intersection of **intentionality** and technical precision is where the best systems are built.

#### Key Implementation Focus:
* **Feature Engineering**: Implementing PAB evaluation logic to streamline loan approvals.
* **Technology Stack**: Utilizing **Java and TypeScript** for scalable, maintainable services.
* **Reliability**: Ensuring that every credit assessment is accurate and handled with zero data loss.

> "Engineering is about the elegance of the solution, not just moving data from A to B."

### Beyond the Code

While I spend my days solving backend puzzles, I believe in maintaining a balance through physical craft. My current projects include designing custom 3D-printed stands in **Fusion 360** and taking condensed notes on **Deep Work** to protect my focus during intense development.

I'm also currently learning **Kannada** to better connect with the community here in Bengaluru.
